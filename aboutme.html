        <p class="aboutme">Hello my name is Cody, welcome to my personal website! I have
           been loving my journey learning web development at Thaddeus Stevens College of
           Technology. We are halfway through just the first semester and I'm excited to
           keep learning more.</p>

          <h3>My Family</h3>
          <img src="images/myfamily.jpg" alt="my family">
          <p class="aboutme">I am a middle child of three with one older sister and one younger.
             I am the first out of my family to go to any college, and I think I might
             be the first in my bloodline to go into this sort of field. I make this
             assumption because my moms side of the family is Amish and my dad's is
             Mennonite, if you dont know what I'm talking about lets just say its far
             from any technology.</p>

          <h3>My Friends</h3>
            <img src="images/friends.jpg" alt="my friends">
            <p class="aboutme">These are my friends, some of us met in our beginning years of
              elementary school and others in middle or highschool. As a group we all love
              traveling but we are also poor. So we instead of flying places we drive there.
              So far, we've done 2 trips 1 from our home in PA to California, and another to
              Canada.</p>

          <h3>My Motorcycle</h3>
            <img src="images/motorcycle.jpg" alt="motorcycle">
            <p class="aboutme">At the start of one summer I got what some call the "motorcycle
              bug", that is when all you can think about is buying and riding a 2 wheeled vehicle.
              So I bought myself a 2018 Yamaha MT-07 and taught myself how to ride and I love it.</p>
